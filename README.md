# Simple voice assistant



In the future, we plan to add features such as smart home control such as Amazon Alexa, etc.


#####  You can also add your suggested codes in the issues I open and support this project!


## Installation and usage guide for developers
Please create a new environment using conda and install Python version 3.8.0. (The reason for using a lower Python version is because the speech_recognition module is not compatible with higher versions!)

Then install the required packages through the requirements.txt file.
